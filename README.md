# Validity-snap
Snap package of the Validity QT wallet.
It can be found in the releases.
Once downloaded,open terminal where the snap package is,and run the command:

snap install --dangerous validity_13.2.1.0_amd64.snap

(It is NOT dangerous,it is a snap that is not on the snap store,yet.And this is the only way to manually install it.It is SAFE!)
